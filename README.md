# SQL-Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to design tables to hold data from 6 fictional CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions on the data. There are three components to the project: 
1. Data Modeling - Inspect the CSV files and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. 
2. Data Engineering - Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, and import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
3. Data Analysis - Using SQL, answer 8 questions on the data. 

Here is the Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables:

Two SQL Query files are provided:
1. EmployeeSQL Table Schemata is the data engineering for creating the 6 tables and importing each CSV file into its SQL table in PostGreSQL.
2. EmployeeSQL data analysis queries is the data analysis conducted to answer the 8 listed questions.
